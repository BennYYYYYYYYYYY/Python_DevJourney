    "1. If we use LBYL, then most of our codes are doing error handling. This decreases the readability of codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. EAFP is usually faster than LBYL, since we don’t need to stop and check all the conditions and possible problems before we execute codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. EAFP can avoid errors during condition checking and the actual execution of codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have LBYL codes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "If (a file exists):\n",
    "    open the file and read the content\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, after we check the file exists, before we open the file and read the content, there’s a chance that other programs go ahead and delete the file. Therefore, even if we check the file exists, we still cannot avoid getting it during execution, and the whole program might just crush.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we do EAFP, then we would do:\n",
    "```\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    open the file and read the content\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    # some error handling codes here\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, we open the file directly. If we get some problems, we can handle that exception during execution, and the program won’t just crush.\n"

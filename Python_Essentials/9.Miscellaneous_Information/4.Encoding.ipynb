    "`ASCII` (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ASCII` codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ASCII` uses 1 byte (8 bits) to do encoding, but actually only 7 bits are used. Therefore, `it encodes 128 (which is 2^7) different characters`, including both upper- and lower-case English letters, numbers from 0 to 9, and symbols such as !@#$%.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it doesn’t include characters from other languages, such as Chinese or Korean letters. \n",

    "# UTF-8\n",
    "Binary digits mapping to Unicode can be implemented in different ways. The most commonly used encoding is `UTF-8`. \n",
    "`UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding with a minimum of 8 bits per character`. Characters with higher code points will take up to 32 bits. `So UTF-8 can encode Unicode characters in a range of 1 to 4 bytes.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the maximum of 4 bytes should be able to map 2^32=4294967296 characters. However, the algorithm we need for `UTF8 encoding support a range of 1 to 4 bytes in memory` puts a limit to this number.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does that work? Each byte starts with a few bits that tell you whether it's a single-byte code-point, a multi-byte code point, or a continuation of a multi-byte code point. For example, a single byte code-point is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0xxx xxxx (A single-byte ASCII code forms the first 127 characters)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The multi-byte code-points each start with a few bits that essentially say, \"hey, you need to also read the next byte (or two, or three) to figure out what I am.\" They are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "110x xxxx One more byte follows \n",
    "1110 xxxx Two more bytes follow \n",
    "1111 0xxx Three more bytes follow\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, the bytes that follow those start codes all look like this:\n",
